# How neugaze Works

This page explains the internals of neugaze's facial authentication pipeline. You don't need it to use neugaze, but it helps understand why it behaves the way it does.

## Security warning

neugaze is currently **not suitable for security-critical authentication**.

Its liveness model raises the bar for printed-photo and screen-photo attacks, but it should not be your only authentication factor. Video replay, high-quality presentation attacks, and missing or disabled liveness checks remain risks.

IR camera support and other anti-spoofing protections are planned for upcoming releases.

## Privacy model

- Face processing runs locally on your machine.
- No cloud account is required.
- Face embeddings are stored on disk under your local neugaze data path.

## Authentication pipeline

```text
Camera frame -> Face detection -> Face alignment -> Embedding -> Similarity match -> Liveness check
```

High level:

1. Camera frame is captured from your configured GStreamer camera source.
2. Detector finds a face and facial landmarks.
3. Face is aligned into a standard input shape.
4. Recognition model creates an embedding vector.
5. Embedding is compared against your enrolled profiles.
6. TBD: If liveness is enabled, a MiniFASNet-V2 anti-spoofing model checks the detected face crop.

If best similarity passes threshold and the liveness score passes threshold, auth succeeds.

## Why multiple captures help

Each enrollment stores multiple samples across slightly different angles.

That makes authentication more robust for:

- Small head rotation
- Minor lighting changes
- Appearance shifts (for example, glasses)

## Where data is stored

Default locations:

- User embeddings: `/var/lib/neugaze/users`
- Model files: `/var/cache/neugaze`
- Config file: `/etc/neugaze/config.toml`

## Components

- `neugazed`: daemon that performs detection and recognition
- `neugaze`: CLI client
- `neugaze-gui`: GTK app
- PAM integration and GNOME extension for login/lock screen flow

The CLI and GUI communicate with daemon over DBus (`com.github.rlneumiller.NeuGaze`).
